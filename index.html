  <h4>About Me:</h4>
<p>Hi, my name is Amelia Bradley and I am a 20yr from Boston, MA. Currently, I work at a hospital in dietary aid and am enrolled in the MSIMBO coding program. Some of my interest include art, music, & fashion.
  From this program I hope to overcome any challenges that I face and be able to take away life long skills in doing so.</p>
